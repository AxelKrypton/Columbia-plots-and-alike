# Needed steps to add a figure to the repository

If you wish to include any new figure into this repository, you need to fork it and open a pull request after having pushed the changes to your fork.
No matter whether your figures are totally new or originating from existing SVG files, it is highly encouraged to stay consistent with the conventions used so far (both w.r.t. colours and lines style).
You shall refer to the [README](README.md) file for technical information.

Once your new material is ready, be sure to accomplish the following steps.

1. Add new or modified SVG files to the ***Svg*** folder.
2. Add new PDF files to the ***Pdf*** folder.
3. Edit the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.yaml) file in order to include there your name where appropriate.
4. Add you as new author to the [CITATION](CITATION.cff) file.
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository.
   As it is difficult to see modifications in SVG files using `git diff`, you are kindly requested to describe changes in your pull requests, if these refer to an existing SVG file.
6. Wait for a review.
   Once changes are accepted and merged, the gallery website will be updated to include your new figure(s).
