# Columbia plots and alike

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This repository gathers in one place all figures related to my research during my Ph.D. and afterwards.
Many people asked me many times if it was possible to get the source files behind the figures, which I then decided to make public, confident that my work will be properly cited and credit given.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to fork it and open a pull request.
It will be my pleasure to merge it in and give credit to you as appropriate.

## Using figures in you work

This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by].
By downloading any image in this repository and using it in future publications, presentations, lectures and similar, you undertake to give credit to the authors citing them as appropriate.
A DOI is associated to this work via Zenodo and there you can export the citation in the format you prefer (BibTeX and many more).
In this case, it is encouraged to use the concept DOI rather than that of a specific version.
The former will in any case always resolve to the latest version of the repository. 

## Some techinical information

All SVG files have been produced using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).
If you open them in versions of the software newer than that used to produce them it might be that some update will be done and, hence, the figure might be changed (typically w.r.t. to text).
For this reason, but also to make everything directly visible and usable, all existing figures have been exported as PDF files to the ***Pdf*** folder.

Furthermore, the SVG files make heavy use of layers, such that all different versions of the _"same"_ plot have the same dimensions, which makes them nice to be used in overlays or animations in presentations.
This also explain why there are much fewer SVG than PDF files.

In the ***Svg*** folder, the file *Technical_specs.txt* contains relevant information about the RGB codes of the colours used as well as how 3D planes have been drawn.
This is meant to stay consistent among different figures and keep using the same approach.
